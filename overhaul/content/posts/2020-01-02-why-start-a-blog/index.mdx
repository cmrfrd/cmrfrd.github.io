# The Art of Abstraction

Abstractions are used to map complexity to an idea for simplified understanding.

They are a time saving medium so you don&rsquo;t need to fully digest an underlying concept, just the high level idea. It can easily be said, but finding the right one is hard. Researchers and engineers spend their whole careers assembling and arguing over the right abstractions. There is simply no one standard way to do it.

Abstractions are thrown out, re-evaluated, superseded, then thrown out again all as part of a process, not an end destination.

At the end of the day abstractions are speculative and up to interpretation, which makes them an artistic endeavor. That&rsquo;s why I wanted to start this blog <span class="underline">**The Art of Abstraction**</span>. My goal is to explore the abstractions made by researchers and engineerings to better understand the invisible and technical world of software, math, and philosophy.


# Why care about blogs?

If your on the internet nowadays, odds are you are consuming some form of written content.

If you are consuming written content, you are almost definately reading it in a *blog* like format with listed articles, authors, and different narratives.

Blogs have now matured from their mid 90s inception to one of the oldest forms of content distribution on the web.

Prominent newspaper/magazine companies have transitioned to posting content in a *blog*, tech companies describe their latest innovations in a *blog*, and even regular people post their latest happenings on their *blog*. This format has formed a cultural niche for itself allowing people to carve out their own corner(s) of the internet.

With so many corners all over the internet, each with their own backstories and insight, there is a massive library of information that serve as a reference for anyone to learn from. Whether you want to learn about [pricing tacos](https://www.bonappetit.com/story/price-of-taco-truck-taco) or [innovations in CNNs](https://distill.pub/2019/computing-receptive-fields/) it&rsquo;s all out there.


# DIY over Platforms

With so many modern platforms out there to post content, it&rsquo;s very viable to sign up for a Blogger, Medium, or WordPress account. However a lot of these platforms pigeonhole you into using pre built templates, confine users from useful plugins as premiums, and regulate the type of content you can host on their servers.

**<span class="underline">The Art of Abstraction</span>** will be internalizing a few key values in pursuit of staying *DIY*.

1.  **Build your needs, opposed to outsourcing them**
2.  **Pursue flexibility over lock-in**
3.  **Keep current**

I believe that with these values, this blog can last for the long haul and resonate with an audience of hackers and developers alike.


# The stack

Inevitably if you want to build a blog from scratch, you need to choose a tech stack.

There are [hundreds](https://github.com/topics/blog-engine) of engines to choose from if you want to build a blog. Each have their own unique utility or are catered towards a specific developer community. To narrow the search there are facile criterion we can choose to abide by the *DIY* values.

1.  **Blog posts should dovetail with projects**
2.  **Blog posts are more then text and images**
3.  **Blog posts should be easy to deploy**

Keeping these criterion in mind, the three technologies I chose to satisfy them are

1.  [**Emacs `org-mode`**](https://orgmode.org/)

    I&rsquo;ve used Emacs and `org-mode` for the past few years for work, note taking, and for managing personal projects. It works extremely well for my workflow and it&rsquo;s the best highly integrated mess I&rsquo;ve ever used.

2.  [**mdx**](https://mdxjs.com/)

    Markdown is an extremely common document writing format that several blogs

3.  [**Gatsby**](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
