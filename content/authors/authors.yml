      Hi! I'm a Data Scientist living in New York. I spend most of my time
      programming, reading, or trying to solve math problems. Other things I'm
      interested in are juggling, Hebrew, and philosophy.

      I love to write about ideas and solutions outside that norm that actually
      work
